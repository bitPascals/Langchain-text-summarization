Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage the arts and commerce.\\nLet both sides unite to heed, in all corners of the earth, the command of Isaiah—to “undo the heavy burdens…and to let the oppressed go free.”\\n\\nAnd if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion, let both sides join in creating a new endeavor—not a new balance of power, but a new world of law—where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved.\\n\\nAll this will not be finished in the first one hundred days.\\nNor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet.\\nBut let us begin.\\n\\nIn your hands, my fellow citizens, more than mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course.\\nSince this country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty.\\nThe graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe.\\n\\nNow the trumpet summons us again—not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need—not as a call to battle, though embattled we are—but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, \"rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation\"—a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.\\n\\nCan we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind? Will you join in that historic effort?\\n\\nIn the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger.\\nI do not shrink from this responsibility—I welcome it.\\nI do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation.\\nThe energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it—and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.\\n\\nAnd so, my fellow Americans:\\nAsk not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.\\n\\nMy fellow citizens of the world:\\nAsk not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.\\n\\nFinally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you.\\nWith a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God’s work must truly be our own.\\n  Translate the precise summary to Spanish\\n'"

During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa.

      "\"Here is a summary of the departing speech of A P J Abdul Kalam:\n",
      "\n",
      "President Abdul Kalam is thanking the people of India and those living abroad for the opportunity to serve as the President of India for five years. He reflects on the many experiences and interactions he had with people from different walks of life, including politics, science, academia, arts, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam then shares 10 important messages that he learned during his tenure:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerate development by fulfilling the aspirations of the youth.\n",
      "2. Empower villages to drive growth.\n",
      "3. Mobilize rural core competence to enhance competitiveness.\n",
      "4. Focus on \"Seed to Food\" to support agricultural growth.\n",
      "5. Overcome problems and succeed through perseverance.\n",
      "6. Partner with others to overcome challenges.\n",
      "7. Show courage in the face of calamities.\n",
      "8. Foster connectivity for societal transformation.\n",
      "9. Defend the nation with pride.\n",
      "10. Mobilize the youth to work towards a Developed India by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is interspersed with personal anecdotes and memories, including a question from a young girl named Anukriti who asked why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020. Kalam assures her that it is a thoughtful question and expresses his commitment to making progress towards that goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question and acknowledged it as thoughtful. They assured the questioner that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and that they would work to make it a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness. The speaker, likely a government official, shares their experience visiting a village in Nagaland where they saw an empowered village council making decisions and taking actions to develop the village. They note that providing physical connectivity through quality roads is crucial for enabling faster movement of products from villages to markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also highlights an initiative by Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, called PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas), which aims to provide urban amenities in rural areas. This includes provision of physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity, leading to economic connectivity. The initiative has resulted in the establishment of health care centers, education institutions, and vocational training centers, leading to large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the success of the Periyar PURA (Participatory Urban Rural Action) project, which has generated employment and created entrepreneurs in 65 villages. The project has transformed 200 acres of barren land into cultivable land, and villagers are now engaged in various activities such as cultivation, plantations, power generation, food processing, and marketing. The project has also enabled the villagers to develop internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products with the support of experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO). The speaker believes that this model can be replicated across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, and that 7000 such PURAs are needed to achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two personal experiences that have given them confidence in the nation's agricultural progress. Firstly, they met over 6,000 farmers from across India at Rashtrapati Bhavan, who showed keen interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasizes the importance of increasing agricultural production with reduced resources and improving the economic conditions of the nation through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. They believe that a partnership between farmers, agricultural scientists, and industries can help achieve a 4% annual growth in agricultural GDP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the speaker recounts a meeting with a man named Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who was born without hands and legs. Despite this, he had a radiant smile and expressed gratitude to God, his parents, teachers, and others for giving him confidence, training, and help. When asked what he needed, he replied that he wanted to sing in front of the speaker, which inspired the speaker to reflect on the importance of defeating problems and succeeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two inspiring stories. The first story is about a person with physical disabilities who has a hidden talent for music. Despite his limitations, he was encouraged by his parents, teachers, and others to pursue his passion, and he even performed at Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre in July 2007. The speaker highlights the importance of a positive attitude and perseverance in overcoming challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second story is about the resilience of the people and children of Jammu & Kashmir after the devastating earthquake in 2005. The speaker visited Urusa village, which was severely affected by the disaster, and was impressed by the villagers' determination to overcome their problems. Despite the significant losses they suffered, the villagers did not give up and instead became the masters of their problems. The speaker praises the courage of the people of Urusa and the role of the Army, Air Force, and state government in providing relief and medical aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be about the importance of courage and resilience in the face of calamities and challenges. The speaker shares two personal experiences where they witnessed courage and optimism among children and communities affected by natural disasters.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first experience, the speaker visited a village that had been affected by an earthquake and saw children and villagers working together with the Armed Forces to provide relief. The speaker notes that the villagers were smiling and interacting with them, and that they were able to provide relief grants to victims whose houses had been damaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the second experience, the speaker visited the Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 Tsunami and met with the tribal islanders. Despite the severe loss of life and destruction, the islanders had taken in the affected victims as their own and were working together to rebuild and rehabilitate. The speaker was moved by their courage and wrote a poem called \"Sea Waves\" which they sang with the islanders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also touches on the theme of connectivity and the importance of working together to achieve societal transformation. The speaker references their address to the Pan African Parliament in Johannesburg, South Africa, where they emphasized the need for connectivity and cooperation to address the challenges facing Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the proposal of a Pan African e-Network, a project aimed at connecting 53 African countries through a seamless and integrated network of satellite, fiber optics, and wireless connections at a cost of $100 million. The project will connect 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa), 17 Super Specialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-medicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers in Africa. The pilot project has already been commissioned in Ethiopia, where students from Addis Ababa and Harmaya Universities are taking an MBA course from Indira Gandhi National Open University. Additionally, specialists from CARE Hospital are providing tele-medicine services to African countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech mentions several achievements and initiatives:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Hyderabad-based company is providing one-hour live tele-consultation to doctors in Black Lion Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in cardiology and radiology since 2006.\n",
      "2. The Pan African network will connect all 53 African countries' heads of state for instant communication, showcasing India's expertise in bringing technology to Africa.\n",
      "3. The speaker, likely the Prime Minister of India, is proud of the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force for their bravery and dedication to duty, sharing personal experiences of visiting Siachen Glacier, INS Sindhurakshak, and flying a Sukhoi-30 fighter.\n",
      "4. The speaker highlights the importance of the Defense Forces, Para-military forces, and police personnel in ensuring the safety and security of citizens.\n",
      "5. The speech also mentions the \"Youth movement for Developed India 2020\" and the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which aims to transform young citizens into enlightened individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is highlighting the importance of empowering the youth of India through value-based education and leadership. They mention the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh, specifically in the Medak district, with positive results such as increased self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and recognition of duties towards the nation. The speaker shares an example of a student leader who successfully persuaded her father to quit smoking after attending a Lead India training camp, demonstrating the impact of the program. The speaker believes that the 540 million youth in India under the age of 25 hold immense power and potential, and that empowering them through value-based education and leadership is crucial for the country's future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural and natural heritage while pursuing economic growth. The speaker expresses confidence in India's potential to become a developed nation by 2020, citing the country's progress over the past 60 years, its natural resources, and the hardworking population, particularly the 540 million youth. The speaker encourages the nation to work together to empower its citizens and achieve the goals of a developed India by 2020, with a focus on:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reducing the rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Ensuring equitable access to energy and quality water\n",
      "3. Developing a harmonious relationship between agriculture, industry, and the service sector\n",
      "4. Providing education with value systems to all meritorious candidates, regardless of social or economic background\n",
      "5. Becoming a destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech concludes with a quote from a famous poem, emphasizing the importance of aiming high and working towards one's goals, and invites citizens to work together to achieve the missions of a developed India by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech outlines a vision for a perfect nation, where:\n",
      "\n",
